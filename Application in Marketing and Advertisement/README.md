Reinforcement Learning is mainly used in Robotics and Teaching an agent to play an Atari game but in this particular project, we will be focussing on marketing strategy. Here we will be showing 10 different Ads(of Car) to the user on any web page to 10,000 different user and recording the response, whether the user has clicked that particular ad or not. So by this model, we will be getting the most viewed ad by the users and then may be the advertisement team will show that ad on TV, so that maximum users can watched it or something else.
